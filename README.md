# csc211
Labs and Assignmensts from Grinnell College SP22 CSC211 

The summary of this file is mostly adapted from Prof. Weinman's website (https://weinman.cs.grinnell.edu/courses/CSC211/2022S).
The starter files are given as class materials.
For labs, used MPLAB IDE to assemble code and download it to the Microstick, Logisim to build a datapath.
For assignments, used Logisim for building circuits and MARS for MIPS programming.

[Labs]
1. Meet the PIC32
Authors:
Date: Mar 08 2022
Summary: Program a MIPS32 microprocessor in MIPS assembly.

2. Blinking Lights
Authors:
Date: Mar 15 2022
Summary: Write MIPS assembly to blink LEDs programmatically.
         Use the protoboardâ€™s switches to blink LEDs in two or more different patterns.
         Write assembly code to call functions, read input, isolate bit fields, and perform conditional execution.

3. Play a Song
Authors:
Date: Apr 08 2022
Summary: Write MIPS assembly to control a speaker, wire a speaker to the PIC32, and play a song.
         Write functions in assembly code, work with arrays stored in memory, and use instructions for multiplication and division.

4. Build a Datapath I
Authors: Autumn Kwon, Will Green
Date: Apr 12 2022
Summary: Begin building a complete datapath for a simple Instruction Set Architecture in Logisim.

5. Build a Datapath II
Authors: Autumn Kwon, Will Green
Date: Apr 22 2022
Summary: Continue completing the datapath for a simple Logisim-based ISA with control-flow and memory instructions.
         Finish implementing most of the PIPS instruction set, with support for jump instructions, conditional branches, and memory operations.
         Use memory-mapped I/O to connect a terminal to the datapath so the programs can actually produce output.
         
6. Build a Datapath III
Authors: Autumn Kwon, Will Green
Date: May 03 2022
Summary: Complete the datapath for a simple Logisim-based ISA, implement additional pseudoinstructions, and add a keyboard for input.
         Finish implementing the PIPS instruction set, add some useful pseudoinstructions with assembler rules, incorporate keyboard input, 
         and write three useful programs using input and output devices.

7. Build a cache
Authors:
Date: May 11 2022
Summary: Implement a direct-mapped cache for a read-only memory in Logisim.

[Assignments]
1. Logisim Adders
Date: Feb 13 2022
Summary: Design and build the first sub-module of a computer; half adder, full adder, 8-bit adder. 
         Build two small circuits to add one-bit binary numbers, then chain these together to produce a larger adder that can add 8-bit numbers.
 
2. Logisim ALU
Date: Feb 20 2022
Summary: Design and build the first major module of a computer.
         Build a 4-bit ALU in Logisim that implements standard arithmetic and logical operations: 
         bitwise AND, OR, NAND, and NOR; addition and subtraction; and less-than comparison.

3. Logisim Register File
Date: Mar 06 2022
Summary: Build a 4x4 register file with four 4-bit registers.

4. MIPS Programming
Date: Mar 13 2022
Summary: Develop a suite of MIPS procedures including conditionals and loops.

5. MIPS Procedures
Date: April 10 2022
Summary: Develop a suite of MIPS procedures including recursion with the stack, tail recursion, arrays, and strings.
